Today again  I am going to discuss about education situation in India. Private schools are like termite in today's society. These schools Undermines the very roots of our society. They are not concerned about education of the society . To earn money these schools are spoiling the future of children. They don't have any concern about quality education. They have become a mine to earn money only. Giving less salary to teacher and hiking fees every year is the only way of running school.
